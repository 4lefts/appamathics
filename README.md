# appamathics

> A collection of apps for classrooms

## Ideas:

- Bars for addition/subtraction/inverse/fractions/ratio
- Geometry apps - triangle, parallelogram angles, areas and perimters. Perpendicular lines.

## to do:
- add footer
- improve stopwatch and timer apps to use system time rather than relying on setInteral()
- differentiate fluency sheets
- tweek tables sheet to only allow customisation of one axis

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
